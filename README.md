# zebra-tag READ-ME


This is a fun little "game" I made. Basically Laser tag. 

What you need to get started : 

1. Working my device - preferably the ones with the green lasers. 
2. An OPU sticker that says  ”  SHP QT “ and print as many as you stickers as you want to play. ONLY use the stickers that have numbers attached to them otherwise it won’t register. 


How it works: 

If you do not already have an account, please create one! It’s easy and free and has password reset ability and usernames with more to come! 

After creating an account, sign in and do one of two things ;

A. If you want to “host” create a room code i.e. ; room , 4, cat, 3257. It could literally be anything. And then you are in the lobby! 

 

B. If you want to “join” just enter your friends ROOM ID in the top left of their screen or they can verbally tell you, whatever works. 


And that’s all you need to do to join your friends and start playing laser tag!
